    makes a decadent adult milkshake.

    <string name="cortado_description">
        A cortado is similar to a latte, but instead of being heavy on milk, it uses equal parts
        espresso and milk and has no foam on top.

    <string name="flat_white_description">A simple way to describe this increasingly popular coffee
        shop drink would be “a small strong latte.” It typically has a higher proportion of espresso
        to milk and slightly less foam than a latte.

    <string name="latte_recipe">
        Put the espresso capsule into the unit.
        Put the milk into a heatproof mug. Hold the mug in one hand and place under
        the steam wand so the bottom of the wand is just below the surface of the milk
        at an angle. Select the Steam function and press the START/STOP knob to start steaming.
        While holding the mug at an angle, allow the steam to move the milk around. Once the milk
        begins to increase in volume, lift the mug up higher so the steam wand immerses deeper
        into the milk (this will prevent large bubbles from forming and will make a nice fine
        milk foam). When the foam has almost reached the top of the mug and you can feel that
        the milk in the mug is quite hot, press the START/STOP knob to stop steaming. Tap the
        mug a few times to remove any larger bubbles.Place one mug underneath the brew head
        and select Single Espresso. Once the espresso has finished brewing, slowly pour the
        steamed milk into the mug with the espresso.

        Brew a single espresso into a small heatproof cup. Put the milk into the Frothing Pitcher.
        If using the EM-160, turn the Steam/Hot Water Knob to the ON position and press the STEAM
        button. Using the Steam/Hot Water Wand, steam the milk until the foam has almost reached
        the top of the pitcher and you can feel that the milk is quite hot. Tap the pitcher a few
        times to remove any larger bubbles. Slowly pour 1½ to 2 ounces of the steamed milk into the
        mug with the espresso.

    <string name="flat_white_recipe">Preparation Brew a double espresso into a heatproof mug. Put
        the milk into the frothing pitcher. If using the EM-160, turn the Steam/Hot Water Knob to
        the ON position and press the STEAM button. Using the steaming wand, steam the milk until
        the foam has reached two-thirds of the way up the pitcher and you can feel that the milk is
        quite hot. Tap the pitcher a few times to remove any larger bubbles. Slowly pour a small
        amount of the steamed milk, about half the volume of the espresso, into the mug with the
        espresso, holding back the foam with a spoon. Top with a very thin layer of foam.
